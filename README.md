#Physics


  This project is my high school independent study for Physics.
  To complete my goal of graduating an entire year early, with Honors and LISA diplomas, I needed to do extra classes outside of school.
  I have done a couple other independent studies in the form of websites (see my <a href="https://github.com/dqsully/">github profile</a>), but this one is my best so far. (I've had a lot more experience now)
